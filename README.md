## Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning to predict stroke risk based on patient clinical and lifestyle data. It includes a trained Random Forest model and an interactive web interface built with Flask.

## Problem Statement

Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the world. Early detection and intervention can drastically reduce mortality and long-term disability. This project aims to predict stroke likelihood from patient data using machine learning techniques.

## Models Evaluated

| Model                | Accuracy | F1 Score | AUC    |
|---------------------|----------|----------|--------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.79     | 0.68     | 0.8548 |
| Random Forest       | 0.99     | 0.99     | 0.9998 |
| XGBoost             | 0.94     | 0.92     | 0.9833 |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 0.97     | 0.96     | 0.9906 |
| Gradient Boosting   | 0.91     | 0.88     | 0.9697 |
| Decision Tree       | 0.98     | 0.97     | 0.9872 |

**Random Forest** was selected for deployment due to superior balance across metrics.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Age distribution and stroke correlation
- BMI vs. Glucose colored by stroke outcome
- Hypertension and smoking trends
- Correlation heatmap between features

Visuals were generated using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` in the notebook.

---

## Features Used

- Age, BMI, Hypertension, Glucose
- Gender, Marriage status
- Residence type, Smoking status (one-hot)

---

## Web App Demo

Built with Flask. Users enter patient information and receive a stroke risk probability along with a color-coded risk bar:

- ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk
- ðŸŸ¡ Mild Risk
- ðŸŸ  Moderate Risk
- ðŸ”´ High Risk

Inputs are validated and scaled before prediction using the same scaler and model from the notebook.
